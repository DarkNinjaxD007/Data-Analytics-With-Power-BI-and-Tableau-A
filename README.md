# Consumer Sales Analytics – Power BI & Tableau Dashboards

This repository showcases two interactive dashboards I created using **Power BI** and **Tableau**, based on a Consumer Sales dataset.  
The goal was simple: take raw retail data and turn it into clear, decision-friendly insights.

## Project Overview

Both dashboards explore the same dataset but from different angles, showing how different BI tools handle the same analytical story.  
They highlight patterns across:

- Sales performance  
- Profitability  
- Product categories  
- Regions and states  
- Customer segments  
- Discount behavior  
- Monthly trends and seasonality

## Why This Project Matters

Coming from a database-focused background, I wanted to push myself deeper into the BI side — building narrative-driven dashboards that communicate insights instantly.  
This project helped me:

- Strengthen my analytical thinking  
- Practice designing dashboards for clarity and usability  
- Understand how different BI tools shape the analytical workflow  
- Produce business-ready visuals that support quick decision-making
